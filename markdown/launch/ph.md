Hey Everybody, Hey Everybody  👋  👋 

We are thrilled to open source NocoDB today. 

<a><b>NocoDB is an open source Airtable alternative.</b></a>

Github : <a href="https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb"><b>https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb </b></a>

NocoDB works by connecting to any relational databases and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface! This allows you to build no-code applications collaboratively with teams. NocoDB currently works with MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, Amazon Aurora & MariaDB databases.

Also NocoDB's app store allows you to build business workflows on views with combination of Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Twilio, Whatsapp, Email to name a few. Plus NocoDB's provides programmatic access to APIs so that you can build integrations with Zapier / Integromat and custom applications too.

🎯 &nbsp;<b>Why we building this ?</b>
Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by a Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at same speed on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lockin, data lockin, abrupt price changes & mostly importantly a glass ceiling on what's possible in future.

<b> ❤️ &nbsp; Our Mission : </b> 
Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code tool for databases as open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise collaborative app building but also bring forth a revolution where a billion+ people will have radical <i>tinkering-and-building</i> abilities on internet.

🔦 &nbsp;<b>Also how it all began .. </b>
We open sourced two API repos before NocoDB :
⚡ A no-code REST APIs generator for any MySQL DB. ~200,000 Docker pulls. This was a hobby project & had no GUI. 📈
⚡ A low-code REST-GraphQL APIs generator for any database with GUI. Used by 100s of companies. Including fortune 500s & publicly trading companies. 📈

The thing that surprised us the most was that even non-developers started using our API products & rooting for us. 🚀 🚀  &nbsp;Whilst everybody loved instant API access to databases, it was slow-and-painful for them to build UI and collaborate with their teams. 💔 💔 ... This made us to rethink, radically re-combine the power of our 2 API products and transform them into something better.

💊 &nbsp;<b>And ... There is ... One last thing ... this is insanely good :</b>
NocoDB can be boiled down to just SIX lines of node.js. So just one file. With six lines of <i>voodoo</i> in it. So, it can run even on a smallest of servers with minimal setup!! Hope you liked it.
